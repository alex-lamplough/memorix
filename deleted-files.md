## Migration Status

### API Consolidation Plan Phases:

1. ✅ **Phase 1: Complete Flashcard Migration**
   - Update components currently using `flashcardService` directly to use React Query hooks

2. ✅ **Phase 2: Complete Todo Migration**
   - Update components currently using `todoService` directly to use React Query hooks

3. ✅ **Phase 3: Quiz Service Consolidation**
   - Create `src/api/adapters/quizAdapter.js`
   - Move core API functions from `quizService` to the adapter
   - Update `src/api/queries/quizzes.js` to use the adapter
   - Mark old service file with deprecation notice
   - Delete quiz-service.js after migration

4. ✅ **Phase 4: Activity Service Consolidation**
   - Create `src/api/adapters/activityAdapter.js`
   - Move core API functions from various services to the adapter
   - Update `src/api/queries/activities.js` to use the adapter
   - Update components to use the new hooks

5. ✅ **Phase 5: API Utilities Migration**
   - Move API utility functions from `services/utils.js` to `api/utils.js`
   - Update imports in affected components

6. ✅ **Phase 6: Subscription Service Migration**
   - Create `src/api/adapters/subscriptionAdapter.js` 
   - Create `src/api/queries/subscriptions.js` for React Query hooks
   - Update components using `subscriptionService` to use the new hooks
   - Delete subscription-service.js after migration

7. ✅ **Phase 7: Complete Migration Cleanup**
   - Delete the remaining service files
   - Remove the `/services` directory
   - Ensure all imports are updated across the codebase

### Completed Updates

The following updates have been completed:

1. ✅ Updated `src/components/Quizzes/QuizCreationModal.jsx` to use React Query hooks instead of `quizService.generateQuestions` and `quizService.createQuiz`
2. ✅ Updated `src/pages/EditQuiz.jsx` to use React Query hooks instead of `quizService.getQuiz` and `quizService.updateQuiz`
3. ✅ Updated `src/pages/Flashcards.jsx` to remove import of `flashcardService` from '../services/api'
4. ✅ Updated `handleRequestError` and `createNavigationHandler` imports to use the new location in `api/utils.js`
5. ✅ Updated `src/hooks/useSubscription.js` to use React Query hooks from `src/api/queries/subscriptions.js`
6. ✅ Updated `src/pages/Settings.jsx` to use React Query hooks for subscription management
7. ✅ Updated all components in `src/components/subscription/` to use React Query hooks instead of direct service calls
8. ✅ Removed all `services` files and migrated functionality to the new adapter/React Query pattern

### Next Steps

The following enhancements should be considered for future development:

1. Implement proper error handling and fallbacks for Activity API 404 errors (currently handled gracefully)
2. Add Stripe environment variable validation to prevent runtime errors with Stripe integration
3. Consider creating an API migration guide for any new component development
4. Improve error handling in API client to provide more user-friendly messages
